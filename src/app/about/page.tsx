          <h2>Meet Founder</h2>
          <p className="text-left">
            Hello readers, I‚Äôm Neha Nagda, an aspiring software developer and
            the founder of ATC. I‚Äôm happy to welcome you to my website! As
            someone who has loved reading, writing, and sharing ideas since my
            teenage years, creating this platform has been a dream come true.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="text-left">
            I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Biology in 2021. At
            that time, I felt like a lost soul, unsure of what to do with my
            life. COVID-19 was still affecting the world, and people were
            struggling physically, mentally, and financially to recover. Like
            many families, mine was also having a tough time meeting financial
            needs, and to support my family, I decided to work until I found my
            true passion or chose a stable, long-term career goal.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="text-left">
            I completed my graduation in 2021 with B.Sc. in Biology. After my
            graduation, I worked as a content reviewer for nearly two years.
            Alongside, I explored other career options and decided to pursue web
            development to become a software developer. After a year of
            learning, I began looking for a job, but my passion for creating
            something of my own led me to the idea of building a website. That‚Äôs
            when the writer in me (who wrote during my teenage years and is not
            a professional writer üòÖ) inspired me to create a writing platform.

            I hope you enjoy reading my articles as much as I enjoy writing
            them.
